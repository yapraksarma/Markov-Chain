# Markov Chain Letter Probability Analysis

This script analyzes English words using **Markov chains** to estimate letter probabilities and generate synthetic words.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Computes **probabilities of first letters** in words.
- Estimates **transition probabilities** between consecutive letters.
- **Generates synthetic words** using Markov chains.
- **Plots probability distributions** for letter sequences.
- Calculates **average word lengths** in real and synthetic datasets.

## ðŸ›  Dependencies

Install required libraries with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
